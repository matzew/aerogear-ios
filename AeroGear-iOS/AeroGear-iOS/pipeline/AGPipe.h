/**
 AGPipe represents a server connection. An object of this class is responsible to communicate with the server in order to perform read/write operations.
 

 ## Save data 

 To store newly created objects on a _remote_ server resource you use the ```save``` method. Currently the objects are _just_ simple map objects but in the future we are looking to support more advanced(complex) frameworks, like *Core Data*.

  In the example below, the ```save``` function stores the given NSDictionary on the server, in this case on a RESTful resource. As arguments it accepts simple blocks that are invoked on _success_ or in case of an _failure_.

    // create a dictionary and set some key/value data on it:
    NSMutableDictionary* projectEntity = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    [projectEntity setValue:@"Hello World" forKey:@"title"];
    // add other properties, like style etc ...

    // save the 'new' project:
    [projects save:projectEntity success:^(id responseObject) {
        // LOG the JSON response, returned from the server:
        NSLog(@"CREATE RESPONSE\n%@", [responseObject description]);
        
        // get the id of the new project, from the JSON response...
        id resourceId = [responseObject valueForKey:@"id"];

        // and update the 'object', so that it knows its ID...
        [projectEntity setValue:[resourceId stringValue] forKey:@"id"];
        
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // when an error occurs... at least log it to the console..
        NSLog(@"SAVE: An error occured! \n%@", error);
    }];


 ## Update data

 The ```save``` method is also responsible for updating an 'object'. However this happens **only** when there is an 'id' property/field available:

    // change the title of the previous project 'object':
    [projectEntity setValue:@"Hello Update World!" forKey:@"title"];
    
    // and now update it on the server
    [projects save:projectEntity success:^(id responseObject) {
        // LOG the JSON response, returned from the server:
        NSLog(@"UPDATE RESPONSE\n%@", [responseObject description]);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // when an error occurs... at least log it to the console..
        NSLog(@"UPDATE: An error occured! \n%@", error);
    }];

 ## Remove data

The AGPipe also contains a ```remove``` method to delete the data on the server. It takes the map object which **must** have an 'id' property/field set, so that it knows which resource to delete:

    // Now, just remove the project:
    [projects remove:projectEntity success:^(id responseObject) {
        // LOG the JSON response, returned from the server:
        NSLog(@"DELETE RESPONSE\n%@", [responseObject description]);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // when an error occurs... at least log it to the console..
        NSLog(@"DELETE: An error occured! \n%@", error);
    }];

In this case, where we have a RESTful pipe, the API issues an HTTP DELETE request.

 ## Read all data from the server

The ```read``` method allows to (currently) read _all_ data from the server, of the underlying AGPipe:

    [projects read:^(id responseObject) {
        // LOG the JSON response, returned from the server:
        NSLog(@"READ RESPONSE\n%@", [responseObject description]);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // when an error occurs... at least log it to the console..
        NSLog(@"Read: An error occured! \n%@", error);
    }];

Since we are pointing to a RESTful endpoint, the API issues a HTTP GET request. The JSON output of the above NSLog() call looks like this:

    (
            {
            id = 8;
            style = "project-234-255-0";
            tasks =         (
            );
            title = "Created from testcase";
        },
            {
            id = 15;
            style = "project-255-255-255";
            tasks =         (
            );
            title = "Some title";
        }
    )

Of course the _collection_ behind the responseObject can be stored to a variable..

 ## Time out and Cancel pending operations

 ### Timeout
 During construction of the Pipe object, you can optionally specify a timeout interval (default is 60 secs) for an operation to complete. If the time interval is exceeded with no response from the server, then the _failure_ callback is executed with an error code set to _NSURLErrorTimedOut_.

 From the todo example above:

    id<AGPipe> projects = [todo pipe:^(id<AGPipeConfig> config) {
        ... 
        [config setTimeout:20];  // set the time interval to 20 secs
    }];
 
 Note: If you are running on iOS versions < 6 and a timeout occurs on a pipe's _save_ operation, the error code is set to _NSURLErrorCancelled_.

 ### Cancel
 At any time after starting your operations, you can call ```cancel``` on the Pipe object to cancel all running Pipe operations. Doing so will invoke the pipe's _failure_ block with an error code set to  _NSURLErrorCancelled_. You can then check this code in order to perform your 'cancellation' logic .

    [projects read:^(id responseObject) {
        // LOG the JSON response, returned from the server:
        NSLog(@"READ RESPONSE\n%@", [responseObject description]);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // when an error occurs... at least log it to the console..
        NSLog(@"Read: An error occured! \n%@", error);
    }];

    // cancel the request
    [projects cancel];
